# QGIS Relations Management Plugin

The **QGIS Relations Management Plugin** is a powerful tool designed to simplify the handling and management of 1:N relationships within a QGIS project. It provides an intuitive interface for viewing, modifying, duplicating, deleting, and exporting project relationships. This plugin is especially useful for managing complex geospatial data that involve linked layers, enabling users to maintain relational integrity and flexibility.

## Key Features:

### View Relationships:
Easily browse and visualize all the 1:N relationships present in your QGIS project. Each relationship shows the parent layer, child layer, and the key fields that form the relationship.

### Modify Relationships:
Modify existing relationships by changing the parent layer, child layer, or the key fields, without the need to recreate them from scratch. This helps maintain consistency while allowing quick updates to project data.

### Duplicate Relationships:
Create a copy of an existing relationship under a new name, ideal for scenarios where relationships have similar structures but need slight variations.

### Delete Relationships:
Safely delete unnecessary or outdated relationships directly from the plugin interface, freeing up your project from redundant relations.

### Export Relationships:
Export all project relationships into a JSON file for easy sharing or backup. This feature is useful for collaboration and version control in larger projects.

### Import Relationships:
Load relationships from a JSON file into your project, allowing for easy restoration or transfer of relational configurations between projects.

### View Relationship History:
Track and view the history of changes made to relationships, providing a clear audit trail and the ability to roll back to previous versions when necessary.

## Why Use This Plugin?

Managing 1:N relationships in a QGIS project can be cumbersome, especially when dealing with large datasets or projects involving multiple layers. This plugin streamlines the process, making it easier to maintain, update, and share relationships between layers, all from a centralized and user-friendly interface. Whether you're working on urban planning, environmental monitoring, or any other geospatial project, this plugin helps maintain the integrity of your data relationships efficiently.
